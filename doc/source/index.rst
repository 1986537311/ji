Xorbits Inference: Model Serving Made Easyü§ñ
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Xorbits Inference(Xinference) is a powerful and versatile library designed to serve language,
speech recognition, and multimodal models. With Xorbits Inference, you can effortlessly deploy
and serve your or state-of-the-art built-in models using just a single command. Whether you are a
researcher, developer, or data scientist, Xorbits Inference empowers you to unleash the full
potential of cutting-edge AI models.


Key Features
------------

üåü **Model Serving Made Easy**: Simplify the process of serving large language, speech
recognition, and multimodal models. You can set up and deploy your models
for experimentation and production with a single command.

‚ö°Ô∏è **State-of-the-Art Models**: Experiment with cutting-edge built-in models using a single
command. Inference provides access to state-of-the-art open-source models!

üñ• **Heterogeneous Hardware Utilization**: Make the most of your hardware resources with
`ggml <https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml>`_. Xorbits Inference intelligently utilizes heterogeneous
hardware, including GPUs and CPUs, to accelerate your model inference tasks.

‚öôÔ∏è **Flexible API and Interfaces**: Offer multiple interfaces for interacting
with your models, supporting RPC, RESTful API(compatible with OpenAI API), CLI and WebUI
for seamless management and monitoring.

üåê **Distributed Deployment**: Excel in distributed deployment scenarios,
allowing the seamless distribution of model inference across multiple devices or machines.

üîå **Built-in Integration with Third-Party Libraries**: Xorbits Inference seamlessly integrates
with popular third-party libraries like `LangChain <https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/providers/xinference>`_
, `LlamaIndex <https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/llm/XinferenceLocalDeployment.html#i-run-pip-install-xinference-all-in-a-terminal-window>`_
, `Dify <https://docs.dify.ai/advanced/model-configuration/xinference>`_
, and `Chatbox <https://chatboxai.app/>`_.
