.. code-block:: bash

  xinference --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9997


Using Xinference In a Cluster
=============================


To deploy Xinference in a cluster, you need to start a Xinference supervisor on one server and Xinference workers
on the other servers. Follow the steps below:

Starting the Supervisor
-----------------------
On the server where you want to run the Xinference supervisor, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash
  
  xinference-supervisor -H "${supervisor_host}"

Replace ${supervisor_host} with the actual host of your supervisor server.

Starting the Workers
--------------------

On each of the other servers where you want to run Xinference workers, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash
  
  xinference-worker -e "http://${supervisor_host}:9997"

Once Xinference is running, an endpoint will be accessible for model management via CLI or Xinference client.
