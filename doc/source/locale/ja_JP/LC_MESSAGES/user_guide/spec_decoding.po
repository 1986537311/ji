"Speculative decoding is a method designed to speed up the inference "
"process of large language models (LLMs). This technique involves using a "
"smaller, quicker \"draft\" model to produce several tokens in advance. "
"These tokens are then checked by a more extensive \"target\" model. If "
"the larger model confirms the tokens generated by the draft model, it "
"leads to significant savings in memory bandwidth and processing time per "
"token. However, if the tokens from the draft model don't match the "
"predictions of the larger model, they are discarded."

"In the example above, the target model is about five times larger than "
"the draft model, and the two models are well aligned. Approximately 86% "
"of the draft tokens are accepted by the target model, resulting in a 25% "
"increase in speed. References ~~~~~~~~~~ - [1] `Fast Inference from "
