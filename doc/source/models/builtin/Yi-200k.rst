Yi-200k
=======

- **Context Length:** 204800
- **Model Name:** Yi-200k
- **Languages:** en, zh
- **Abilities:** generate
- **Description:** The Yi series models are large language models trained from scratch by developers at 01.AI. The first public release contains two bilingual (English/Chinese) base models with the parameter sizes of 6B and 34B. Both of them are trained with 4K sequence length and can be extended to 32K during inference time.

Specifications
