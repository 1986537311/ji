# Plexar: Model Serving Made Easy ü§ñ

Welcome to the Plexar GitHub repository! 

Plexar is a powerful and versatile platform designed to serve language, speech recognition, and multimodal models. With Plexar, you can effortlessly deploy and serve your or state-of-the-art built-in models using just a single command. Whether you are a researcher, developer, or data scientist, Plexar empowers you to unleash the full potential of cutting-edge AI models.

Currently, Plexar relies on [ggml](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml) for model serving, which is specifically designed to enable large models and high performance on commodity hardware. We are actively working on expanding Plexar's support to include additional runtimes, including PyTorch and JAX, in the near future.

## Key Features

üåü **Model Serving Made Easy**: Plexar simplifies the process of serving large language, speech recognition, and multimodal models. With a single command, you can set up and deploy your models for experimentation and production.

üåê **State-of-the-Art Models:** Experiment with cutting-edge built-in models using a single command. Plexar provides access to state-of-the-art open-source models including LLaMA, Whisper and more! 

üñ• **Heterogeneous Hardware Utilization**: Make the most of your hardware resources. Plexar intelligently utilizes heterogeneous hardware, including GPUs and CPUs, to maximize performance and accelerate your model training and inference tasks.

‚öôÔ∏è **Flexible API and Interfaces:** Plexar offers multiple interfaces for interacting with your models. You can utilize the RPC and RESTful API to integrate your models with existing systems or use the command-line interface (CLI) and the intuitive WebUI for seamless management and monitoring.

üîå **Built-in Integration with Third-Party Libraries:** Plexar provides seamless integration with popular third-party libraries like LangChain and LlamaIndex.
